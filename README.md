### PasswordGenerator

### Motivation

* The motivation behind making this password generator was, and still is, keeping the security of everyone's personal profile's safe. Every year, millions of people have their accounts hacked whether it's social media or bank accounts. Data breaches are almost an inevitability in today's world, so having multiple, very complicated passwords across all platforms prevents hackers from accessing all your information at once. This password generator has the ability to make very long and complicated passwords that make it more difficult for hackers to penetrate your accounts. Seeing people's entire lives be ruined because of having the same easy passwords across all of their accounts is a big factor in creating this password generator.

### Build status

* This build is currently in it's final form. In the future there may be some updates to include settings such as saving passwords to clipboard. There may also be an update where passwords are saved from the password generator to whichever website is chosen. Saving information would require lots of security measures so it might be a while before that happens.
